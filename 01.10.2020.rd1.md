## Round 1
## Rosemount TA vs Simley AA

## AC
There is no problem if you go a bit faster if you want in front of me.  The case is very straight forward and should work well in this round.  Is the second contention supposed to be some sort of plan specific language?  I'm just not sure how you can choose where this money would go specifically.

## NC
I would suggeset that you take some prep time between the AC and reading your case.  This would give you time to come up with more arguments that you can read against the affirmative case.  When you are done reading your case you want to make sure that you spend some time responding directly to the affirmative case.

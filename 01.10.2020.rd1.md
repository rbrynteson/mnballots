## Round 1
## Rosemount TA vs Simley AA

## The Round

#### AC
There is no problem if you go a bit faster if you want in front of me.  The case is very straight forward and should work well in this round.  Is the second contention supposed to be some sort of plan specific language?  I'm just not sure how you can choose where this money would go specifically.

#### NC
I would suggest that you take some prep time between the AC and reading your case.  This would give you time to come up with more arguments that you can read against the affirmative case.  When you are done reading your case you want to make sure that you spend some time responding directly to the affirmative case.

#### 1AR
You do a nice job of staying the course for the most part.  It took a few minutes now you are crushing it in this speech.  Your split isn't great and I would tell you to take a different strategy in this round.  Instead of going Neg-Aff given the number of drops I would go Aff-Neg.  Tell me that framework has been dropped and we are using the AC framework, so now all you need to do is show a single piece of offense from the aff and therefore you win.  Then you can cleanly extend a contention and the debate is done.  In this case, you could drop the entire NC and still win.  However, by going Neg-Aff you spend too much time on the neg case and you undercover the AC and drop arguments on your side.

#### 2NR
You absolutely want to use prep time so that you can respond to the arguments made by the affirmative.  Think about what arguments the affirmative made and then respond directly to those arguments.

#### 2AR
If an argument is new, why would you need to reply to them.  Look to the judge, I nodded that they were new, so you know that I'm nt going to use them in this round.  So this just is taking up time and keeping you from getting to the voting issues.

## RFD

#### Framework
The AC framework is dropped in the 1N.  This allows the affirmative to clear extend the entire framework and therefore we are using the V/C of Life and Min Risk

#### Overbay
The aff simply needs to show one single argument that decreases the risk against life.  This is shown in this card that nukes are an existential threat to the world.  This is enough for me to pull the trigger for the aff.

#### Spending
Extra offense, I can solve all sort of education problems if I affirm.

So in the end I affirm.

28.5 - 26.0

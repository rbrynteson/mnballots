## Round 5
## Lakeville North JT vs Lakeville South LS

## The Round

#### AC
How is the hacking/cyber impacts unique to the aff.  Wouldn't some military equipment also still have problems as the nuke equipment.  Also, the arms race doesn't seem specific to the nuke arsenals so it doesn't make a ton of sense.  Lastly, my biggest issue with this aff (and most affs on this topic so far) is the harms are all "maybe, something, might happen" in the future but nothing measurable.  So this will make weighing very difficult at the end of the round.

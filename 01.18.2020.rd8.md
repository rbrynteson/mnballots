## The Round

#### AFF
AC: Is there any structure to this case?  Seems like a million paraphrased cards hence the six hours of having to trade cards.

Let people answer the questions.

AR: I feel like every card being read lacks any sort of warrant and it's just the headline of the article being read.  I would like a bit more depth to the arguments, you have time.

#### NEG
NC: Good case structure overall.  I like how specific you are.  I would maybe go into the idea of removal of Maduro is the primary idea.

NR: This is a great job overall.  I wanted a bit more on the framework.  Signposting is a bit of a mess at times.

#### AFF SUMMARY
Where is the summary in the summary?  I have no clue what the offense is out of the AC is now.  Sign posting was also a mess, so now I have stuff all over the flow.  Slow down, tell a story.

#### NEG SUMMARY
I would love to start to see more of a summary in this speech.  There is SO MUCH line-by-line and not an actual summary.

## RFD

#### Framework
The framework is short vs long term.  Neg gives me the first bit of timeframe argumentation, the response is short must come first.  I guess this is true.  This is just a back and forth and no one actually impacts to short vs long term.

#### Maduro
So I believe the neg evidence that Maduro is going to remain in power if we remove the sanctions.  There is no reason for Maduro to step down in a world without sanctions.

I believe that negotiations are happening and might happen in the future.

#### Russia
I guess they might stick around but why do I care about this?  I honestly don't know.  Is Russia bad?  Does this keep Maduro in power.  If so, don't both sides keep in power?  This isn't make a ton of sense to me right now.

#### Famine
I buy the negative argument that the famine should have happened already.  The answer in CX that it's happening now is SUPER NEW.  Why not tell me that the famine is happening right now.  Why bother with the in the next year non-sense?

#### Aid
I believe the aid is getting through.  This is done by both the red cross and also the change in policy.

So in the end this is REALLY hard.  No one weights any arguments anywhere on the flow.  So I vote neg because I'm not sure any positive change comes out of removing sanctions.

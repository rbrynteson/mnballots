## Round 3
## John Marshall CM vs Eagan AK

## The Round

#### AC
Overall the case is really straight forward and makes complete sense.  I would be super careful anytime you are asked "if I prove X, does that mean I win" kind of questions.  The neg is trying to set you up for some sort of harm in the round.  Never give a yes/no answer to that type of question.  You are better to turn the question back to the negative.

#### NC
Please slow down.  There is no reason to go this fast.  Also please watch the pre-written blocks as they don't really respond to the AC arguments.  Also on the bio weapons if nukes deter us from killing each other, if bio-weapons are just as bad as nukes, why won't they have the same deter effect.  Seems like a logical leap of the NC to me.  You first answer and say bio-weapons are a deterrant and then you said people will switch to them and kill each other in CX.  Which one is it?

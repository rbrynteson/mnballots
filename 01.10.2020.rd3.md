## Round 3
## John Marshall CM vs Eagan AK

## The Round

#### AC
Overall the case is really straight forward and makes complete sense.  I would be super careful anytime you are asked "if I prove X, does that mean I win" kind of questions.  The neg is trying to set you up for some sort of harm in the round.  Never give a yes/no answer to that type of question.  You are better to turn the question back to the negative.

## Round 3
## John Marshall CM vs Eagan AK

## The Round

#### AC
Overall the case is really straight forward and makes complete sense.  I would be super careful anytime you are asked "if I prove X, does that mean I win" kind of questions.  The neg is trying to set you up for some sort of harm in the round.  Never give a yes/no answer to that type of question.  You are better to turn the question back to the negative.

#### NC
Please slow down.  There is no reason to go this fast.  Also please watch the pre-written blocks as they don't really respond to the AC arguments.  Also on the bio weapons if nukes deter us from killing each other, if bio-weapons are just as bad as nukes, why won't they have the same deter effect.  Seems like a logical leap of the NC to me.  You first answer and say bio-weapons are a deterrant and then you said people will switch to them and kill each other in CX.  Which one is it?

#### 1AC
You are missing a critical argument.  She said that your framework says death is much worse than the fear based argument.  So as you continue to make arugments about the fear of nuke war, these aren't going to matter in the end of the debate because we will be looking a purely a numbers game of how many lives are saved (or lost).  Also, be careful not to contradict yourself.  You tell me in Cont III that we should switch to nuke energy but your answer to "no accidents" is look at my Chamberline example of just nuke energy, we destroyed the environment and it was just energy.  This turns your own case, lets see if the negative picks up on that.

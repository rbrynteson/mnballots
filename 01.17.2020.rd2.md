## Round 2
## East Ridge BR vs STMA AS

## The Round

#### AFF
AC: Why is it bad that Russia/China increases it influence in the country?  Are they inherently bad?  You have to give me a warrant to the impact, you can't just assume they are a bad actor.  Also, nearly all of these cards sound like they are not specific to sanctions.  It sounds like just a bunch of history lessons of bad stuff happening in Venezuelan. 

AR: That is a HUGE leap to say that funding has remained the same with regards to Hezbollah.  I don't think your case is specific to this so not sure the cross application makes sense.

#### NEG
NC: I would love more warrant in these cards.  It feels like a lot of paraphrasing.  I count 24 different sources in a four minutes?  This might be a bit much.

NR: Good coverage and smart moves to drop out of Cont I and Cont II.  This is a bizarre CX interaction.  You seem to be not very interested in this CX.

#### AFF SUMMARY
This is a confusing speech to me.  You are doing a line-by-line refutation of the case yet you are ignoring ALL of the turns put on the case.  Hold on, Russia is or will be purchasing PDVSA?  Would this purchase continue post removal of sanctions?  How does removing sanctions stop this purchase from happening?  I'm really confused right now.

#### NEG SUMMARY
I would love a bit more of a summary here as opposed to a larger line-by-line argument.  Also you need more weighing in this round.

## RFD

#### Framework
The framework is CBA.  Offered by the aff and never replied to so that is what we are using.

#### Arguments
Yes, weighing in final focus!!!  Please everyone do more of this.

#### Democracy
So the neg is winning this very clearly.  The aff doesn't really reply to the 80% / 2020 card other than to say he is going to leave either way.  This doesn't make sense and doesn't respond to this card at all.  I find it hard to believe this evidence is real but it goes essentially dropped so it's real in this round.

So if this is true, than ALL of the aff offense goes away because Maduro goes away and none of the bad stuff happens in Venezuela.  Sound fishy but again aff response is near non-existent here.

So with that said, I just need to find one piece of offense from the negative and that comes from Cont III.  Removing sanctions, leads Trump to send in the military and people die.  That is bad.

I vote neg.

## Round 4
## Apple Valley JS vs Lakeville KN

## The Round

#### AC
So why would you ask me if I want full source cites, my answer is to follow the rules, and then you still don't read them.  So confused.  Also, you need to tell me why "destroying the US" is a good thing.  Wouldn't that potentially be a bad thing?  You make an assumption that the US military power is bad.  Lastly, I would tell you to slow down a bit.

#### NC
Isn't the storage problem you specify non-unique for both the aff and neg.  If you affirm, you need to store the plutonium somewhere.  If you negate, we still have to store it somewhere, right?  Just curious how the NC would handle this argument.  You spend far too much time on the top of the AC and not on Cont II.  If the framework is going to be about reducing structural violence, why not save and spend more time on his Cont II which is about oppression as it directly links to your framework.
